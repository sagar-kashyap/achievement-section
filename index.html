						<h1>About</h1>
				
						<p>
							The founding organization KLE Society, Belgaum, established BVB college in 1947 with an aspiration of creating an institution that would lay the foundation of modern engineering education in northern region of Karnataka. Over the years, it evolved to reach and hold a unique position of pride in the technical education system of India. As we entered into the 21st century, the college undertook comprehensive reform process to adapt to the challenging global engineering education scenario. In pursuit of academic excellence, the college attained academic autonomy from University Grant Commission (UGC) in the year 2007. As an autonomous the college, BVB established its distinctive character in the academic space through its curriculum and outstanding student experience.<br>
Over the time it gained tremendous credibility with the industries and employers and emerged as a brand to reckon with.  The Alumni of the Institute have done exceedingly well in all spheres of life at both national and international levels and brought name and fame for themselves as well as to their Alma Mater.
